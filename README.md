# 3D Interactive Scene

This repository contains the files that were used to create an interactive 3D scene, which was developed as part of the Computer Graphics and Augmented Reality in third year, first semester of my studies at University of Coimbra, in Portugal. The scene contains:

- A **house** with detailed interior elements.  
- **Furniture**, including **tables and chairs**.  
- An **aquarium with animated fish** that move and can dynamically change their shape.
- A **sink**, adding more realism to the scene.  

The project also features a **dynamic camera**, allowing the user to navigate through the environment and explore different perspectives of the scene.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

All source files are located in the `src/` directory:  

- [Notebook](3D_Interactive_Scene_Notebook.ipynb) – The main Jupyter Notebook containing code and documentation for the 3D scene.
- [Images](images/) – Folder containing texture images applied to objects in the scene.  

## 🛠 Features  

- **3D Interactive Scene**: A fully navigable 3D environment representing a house.  
- **Dynamic Camera**: Users can move through the scene to explore different angles.  
- **Animated Fish**: Fish move inside the aquarium and dynamically change shape, adding interactivity.  
- **WebGL & Shader-Based Rendering**: Uses JavaScript libraries to render 3D objects inside a browser.  
- **Texturing**: Textures applied to walls, furniture, and aquarium elements.  

## 🖥️ Technologies Used  

- **JavaScript** – Main programming language used for rendering.  
- **WebGL & GLSL** – Used for real-time 3D rendering.  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Voilà)** – Used as an execution environment.  
- **JavaScript Libraries (CGRA Framework)** – Provides utilities for handling 3D objects.  

## 🚀 Running the Application  

To run the project, open the **Jupyter Notebook** and execute it using the **Voilà** button, which renders the 3D scene inside the notebook.
